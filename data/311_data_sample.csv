There's heavy morning congestion for those heading southbound on Menchaca attempting to get on Eastbound Ben White as the left lane is left turn only & the middle lane is straight only. Allowing the middle lane to turn left & go straight would prevent the current issue of vehicles illegally turning left from the middle lane due to the long line for the left lane.
